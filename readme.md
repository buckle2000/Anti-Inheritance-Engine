TL;DR: This is a minimalist Unity-like game engine.

This is a **literally** Entity-Component-System based game engine.
Unlike other ECS-like engines like [awe6](https://github.com/hypersurge/awe6) and [luxe](http://luxeengine.com/), this project use a true ECS-framework [eskimo](https://github.com/PDeveloper/eskimo) to simply many things, for example the eventloop.
